<p>I read a lot of preprints on the arxiv, and frequently reach out to authors with a rather thorough list of typos. 
Here I have compiled a (currently incomplete) list of preprints where I have been acknowledged for this. The dates listed are  when I read the relevent papers.</p>

<p>If you wish to acknowledge me, I prefer to be referred to as Zach Hunter. Please do not feel obliged to acknowledge me if all I've done is point out some minor typos (though you are free to do so)!</p>
